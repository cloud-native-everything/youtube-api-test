# Containerized a script to test Youtube API in node.js
How did I come up with a post title like this? bare with me for a few more seconds in this introduction.

I am IT pro, not a Dev. Then, when I tried to test some youtube APIs to start doing some automation. Well, my first issue was. How can I test my API credentials fast? Looking up the answer, I've realized: There's no fast path. Finally, I ended  trying some python and node.js scripts from github whit so many errors, because the versions or the modules (some of them were deprecated), that I decided to go back to basic with a post from Youtube Developers called  Node.js Quickstart  (yeah! it's very basic, I know)

Then I wanted to do it easy and clean. I decided to use containers. I didn't want install more packages in my system with so many virtual instances and containers running in it. Also, it will help to keep some conditions over the time. even if I use a different OS later. I won't need to look up again how to install Node.js in my server.

Also, It's a great exercise to understand the value of containers and how can I take some script and encapsulated with the things it will need in it: Containerized a script to test Youtube API in node.js
